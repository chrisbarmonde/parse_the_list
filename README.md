The List Parser
===============

This is just a basic parser for The List, a Bay Area concert guide compiled and emailed weekly by Steve Koepke. The biggest challenge is that, while there is a basic overall format for how shows are listed, there are a lot of tiny little deviations here and there that creep in from time-to-time. It wouldn't be terribly surprising if this parser breaks at some point.
